The Limits of Partisan Motivated Reasoning in Congress \n(with Tevfik Murat Yildirim) \n\nAbstract: Downplaying the level of risk associated with COVID-19—along with opposition to public health measures aimed at containing the virus—became a rallying cry for the US Republican Party throughout the pandemic. Yet, to what degree are elites ‘blind partisans’, willing to take on the positions of their parties regardless of potential consequences? In this article, we argue that individual self-interest motivations can transcend partisan motivated reasoning. We demonstrate our argument in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the effects of COVID-19 infection on opposition to COVID-19 mitigation policies among United States’ legislators. We adopt a staggered difference-in-difference design and use both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives to illustrate that COVID-19 infection led to a reduction of around 32 percent in legislators’ expressed opposition to measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our findings highlight the limits of partisan motivated reasoning for an issue as salient as COVID-19 and for an institution as polarized as the US Congress.\n\n3. Social class and representation: The effects of socialization on MPs’ responsiveness\n\n\nAbstract: It is an increasingly obvious conclusion that government is more responsive to higher class voters. Such findings are deeply problematic for conceptions of equal democratic representation, but we still have limited understanding of the various mechanisms driving unequal responsiveness. In this article, I argue that representatives’ educational socialization affects how they respond to the working class. I apply this argument in the context of the United Kingdom’s House of Commons by focusing on representatives’ communication from 2017–2021. Using an original dataset that combines 151 repeated public opinion surveys, as well as representatives’ communication online and in parliament, I show that MPs educated at one of the two Oxbridge Universities – Oxford and Cambridge – are more responsive to the middle class while simultaneously less responsive to the working class in relation to MPs with other educational backgrounds. The results of the article contribute to literature on descriptive (mis-)representation as a driver of unequal responsiveness to working class voters. \n\n2. Are Women Representatives More Responsive to Women’s Issue Priorities? \n\nAbstract: There is a long list of normative benefits associated with increasing women’s descriptive representation and past research has shown empirically the substantive benefits women in legislatures provide. Yet, the extent to which women representatives are more responsive to shifts in the priorities of the national public opinion is unexplored and the focus of this article. Using British and American representatives’ dynamic communication on social media, as well as 351 repeated surveys to measure public salience, I demonstrates that women are more responsive than their male counterparts to shifts in issue salience from women specifically and the national public more broadly. These findings challenge the idea that women voters are the sole beneficiaries of an increased female presence in politics and illustrate that responsiveness is not a zero-sum game in that women in parliament outperform men both in responding to the women they represent as well as to the national public.\n\n1. Who Sets the Agenda? Legislative Responsiveness to NGOs, Corporations and the Media \n\nAbstract: Who holds power in a representative democracy can be identified by determining who sets the political agenda. Yet, competing for political attention is no easy task as MPs are recipient to constant demands from all different directions. In this article, I explore the degree to which parliamentarians are responsive to media organizations, multinational corporations and NGOs on a number of issues using social media data from Twitter. Using a new dataset of over two million tweets, issue attention to different issues is identified and measured using a temporal content analysis approach that relies on semi-supervised machine learning. Vector autoregression (VAR) models are then fitted to capture the extent to which a shift in issue attention from one actor (at t-1) predicts a shift in another actor’s attention (at t). Findings reveal broad support for the agenda-setting influence of the media and corporations in British politics. \n\nWorks in progress\nYouth Suffrage and Legislative Responsiveness to Climate Change: Evidence from Scotland \n(with Tevfik Murat Yildirim) \n\nAbstract: While the vast majority of countries around the world require that voters be 18 years of age to cast a ballot, advocates of extending the franchise to include individuals aged 16 and over point to greater engagement, and countries that have lowered the voting age to 16 have witnessed increased political participation compared to some older groups. While a handful of studies have looked at the effects of lowering the voting age to 16 on political knowledge or participation, we have almost no understanding of how youth enfranchisement influences legislative behavior. In this article, we adopt a quasi-experimental design and the synthetic control method to examine legislative responsiveness following 2014 legislation that lowered the minimum voting age from 18 to 16 in Scotland. Analysis of 1.8 million legislative speeches from the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament over the course of two decades indicates that lowering the voting age had only marginal effects on legislative responsiveness to younger voters. We conclude that enfranchisement of 16- and 17 year-olds does not go far enough to address a lack of substantive representation of young people. \n\nIntra-party Preference Diversity and Party-Voter Congruence\nBuying influence in the House of Commons\n  \nBlog Posts & Other Publications\n\nSo Hormonal. 2020.
