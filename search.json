    "text": "My PhD thesis is a collection of four essays that explore the tension between elites’ socialization and self-interest and the ways in which the two influence legislative responsiveness to public opinion. The thesis broadly focuses on explanations for differential responsiveness to public opinion by examining the socialization factors underlying descriptive representation such as gender and class. I argue and demonstrate that these factors play a fundamental roles in shaping legislative behavior; yet, self-interest motivations account for substantial variation in legislative responsiveness to the public. For a deeper look at my doctoral research, which is supervised by  Sergiu Gherghina  and  Sergi Pardos-Prado, feel free to to download a extended abstract  here  \nPrior to my current doctoral research at the University of Glasgow, I earned my masters in international relations at the University of Edinburgh and my bachelor’s degree in political science at Northeastern Illinois University in my hometown of Chicago."
